**TaskFi** is a minimalist, crypto-powered anti-procrastination app built on Polygon (testnet: Amoy for now). Users stake crypto to commit to personal tasks, upload proof when complete, and reclaim their stake if successful â€” or risk losing it to others. It blends the power of **financial incentives** with **human accountability**, with AI verifying proof of completion.

## Business Case

Blockchain adoption has often leaned toward deeply technical, niche use cases. But mass adoption for crypto and Polygon will come from **simple, relatable apps** that solve real problems, especially those with the potential for **virality**.

One such problem? **Procrastination**.

Primary data collected from our team on university campuses (in 2022) show that **100% of students procrastinate regularly**. This is a massive issue, and so far the endless list of productivity apps havenâ€™t solved it.

We followed the startup adage: **build a solution for a real problem** â€” and built TaskFi.

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

This app tackles procrastination using two powerful motivators:

1. ðŸ’¸ **Monetary Commitment** â€” Users stake POL against their goals. Failing to follow through costs them.
2. ðŸ‘€ **Human Accountability** â€” Tasks are public by default. Others can see your progress or failure, adding social pressure.

Combining these elements, TaskFi becomes a natural productivity tool with real incentives, all backed by verifiable, transparent smart contracts.

To add a fun, viral mechanic: users who frequently complete meaningful tasks can **claim a portion of forfeited deposits** from users who fail theirs. This is governed by a **Claim Score** system.
